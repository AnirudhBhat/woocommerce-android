This round of WooCommerce mobile app updates is all about fixes. We addressed rare crashes that occurred when adding a new product category, reordering photos, editing text, creating shipping labels, and filtering products. We also updated a timeout limit for server requests and removed the obsolete purchase details card from product details.
